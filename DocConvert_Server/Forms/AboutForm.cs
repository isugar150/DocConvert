Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be\r\nprotected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (\"Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights\"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not\r\nlimited to, the following:\r\n\r\n  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,\r\n     communicate, and translate a Work;\r\n ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);\r\niii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person\'s image or\r\n     likeness depicted in a Work;\r\n iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,\r\n     subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;\r\n  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data\r\n     in a Work;\r\n vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the\r\n     European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal\r\n     protection of databases, and under any national implementation\r\n     thereof, including any amended or successor version of such\r\n     directive); and\r\nvii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the\r\n     world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national\r\n     implementations thereof.\r\n\r\n2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention\r\nof, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,\r\nirrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of\r\nAffirmer\'s Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes\r\nof action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as\r\nfuture claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories\r\nworldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or\r\ntreaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future\r\nmedium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,\r\nincluding without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional\r\npurposes (the \"Waiver\"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each\r\nmember of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer\'s heirs and\r\nsuccessors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to\r\nrevocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or\r\nequitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public\r\nas contemplated by Affirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason\r\nbe judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the\r\nWaiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into\r\naccount Affirmer\'s express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the\r\nextent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected\r\nperson a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,\r\nirrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer\'s Copyright and\r\nRelated Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the\r\nmaximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future\r\ntime extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number\r\nof copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without\r\nlimitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the\r\n\"License\"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was\r\napplied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any\r\nreason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such\r\npartial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder\r\nof the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she\r\nwill not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related\r\nRights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of\r\naction with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer\'s\r\nexpress Statement of Purpose.\r\n\r\n4.

Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or\r\n    warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,\r\n    statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of\r\n    title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non\r\n    infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or\r\n    the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to\r\n    the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.\r\n c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons\r\n    that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without\r\n    limitation any person\'s Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.\r\n    Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary\r\n    consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the\r\n    Work.\r\n d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a\r\n    party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to\r\n    this CC0 or use of the Work.";

You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files; and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n      (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\r\n\r\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\r\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"[]\"\r\n      replaced with your own identifying information.
